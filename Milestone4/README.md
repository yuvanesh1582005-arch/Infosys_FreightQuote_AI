# Agentic AI for Maritime Freight Pricing & Route Optimization

**Infosys Springboard Internship — Milestone 4**

FreightQuote AI is a maritime freight decision-support application that combines multiple AI agents, machine-learning models, document retrieval, route analysis, pricing tools, and an AI Copilot in one Streamlit-based platform.

The main goal of Milestone 4 is to bring the individual capabilities developed during the earlier milestones into a more connected application where users can analyse shipments, compare carriers, estimate freight costs, inspect weather and customs risks, and ask questions through a grounded AI assistant.

> 💡 **In simple terms:** think of FreightQuote AI as one dashboard that replaces several spreadsheets and manual lookups a freight broker would normally juggle — pricing a shipment, checking if a carrier is reliable, seeing if a storm will delay a port, and asking a chatbot for answers instead of digging through documents.

```

### How a Copilot request is handled

1. The user's question is classified by the intent router.
2. Relevant information is retrieved from SQLite or a calculation tool.
3. If the answer requires a document, the RAG pipeline searches the indexed PDFs.
4. Retrieved information is passed to the local Qwen model.
5. The Copilot generates an answer based on the available context.
6. NLLB-200 can translate the response when required.

The design aims to keep the Copilot grounded in application data rather than generating unsupported freight values.

## 🗃️ Data & Storage

SQLite acts as the main application database.

The database stores operational information such as:

- Ports
- Shipments
- Carriers
- Routes
- Freight quotes
- Customs requirements
- Weather-risk information
- Operational records
- ML metrics

Demo data can be generated or prepared through the project's data-seeding pipeline.

---

## 🔄 Milestone 4 Execution Flow

The recommended order for running the complete application is:

```text
Prepare Data
     ↓
Seed SQLite Database
     ↓
Prepare PDF / RAG Index
     ↓
Load Qwen + Translation Engines
     ↓
Start AI Agents
     ↓
Verify Authentication & RBAC
     ↓
Run End-to-End Tests
     ↓
Launch Streamlit
     ↓
Expose Application
```

This order reduces dependency issues because the Copilot and several agents require database and document-retrieval components to be ready first.

---

## 🚀 Running the Project

## 📖 Glossary (Simple Terms)

A few shipping terms used throughout this README, explained simply:

| Term | Simple Meaning |
|---|---|
| **BAF** | Bunker Adjustment Factor — an extra fee added to cover changing fuel prices |
| **TEU** | Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit — the standard way to measure how much a container can hold |
| **HS Code** | A code used worldwide to classify goods for customs purposes |
| **Dwell Time** | How long cargo sits at a port before it moves on |
| **Bill of Lading** | A shipping receipt/legal document showing what's being shipped and to whom |
| **RAG** | Retrieval-Augmented Generation — the AI looks up real documents before answering, instead of guessing |
| **RBAC** | Role-Based Access Control — different users see different features depending on their role |
| **OTP** | One-Time Password — a temporary code sent to your email to verify it's really you |

---

## ❓ Quick FAQ

**Q: Do I need a GPU to run this?**
A local LLM (Qwen) works best with a GPU, which is why the project is designed to run on Google Colab. It can fall back to a smaller model or CPU mode if no GPU is available, though responses will be slower.

**Q: Is the data real?**
No — ports, shipments, carriers, and customer data are generated for demo purposes. Only the live weather data (from Open-Meteo) is real-time.

**Q: Can the AI Copilot make up numbers?**
It's designed not to. The Copilot is instructed to answer only from data it can retrieve (the database or uploaded PDFs) and to say so clearly when it doesn't have enough information.

**Q: What happens if the 3B model can't load?**
The app automatically falls back to the smaller Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model so the Copilot keeps working, just with slightly less detailed responses.

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations & Future Scope

### Current Limitations
- Uses generated/synthetic data for most modules rather than live commercial freight data.
- SQLite is used for simplicity, which limits how many people can use the app at the same time.
- Designed as a single-organization demo rather than a multi-company production system.

### Possible Future Improvements
- Connect to real freight-rate and carrier APIs instead of demo data.
- Move to a more scalable database for multiple concurrent users.
- Add more languages and refine translation accuracy for maritime-specific terms.
- Expand the RAG knowledge base to update automatically from a shared document folder.
